The changes include:\n\n- Addition of Terraform configurations for S3 backend storage in both `us-east-1` and `us-east-2` regions for the Phoenix UI project.\n- Integration of Vault provider for secure access to AWS credentials.\n- Implementation of IAM roles for various components such as a3po, action-engine, aether, and others, with appropriate tagging for resource management.\n- Configuration of default tags for AWS resources to ensure consistent metadata across environments.\n- Update of Terraform provider versions to ensure compatibility and leverage new features.\n\nThese changes are necessary to enhance the infrastructure's scalability, security, and maintainability. The SRE and development teams will benefit from these improvements as they streamline resource management and deployment processes.\n\n### If the (atlantis) plan is destroying resources, reason for deletion\n\nNo resources are being destroyed as part of this change. The focus is on adding and configuring new resources.\n\n### Additional details\n\n- [x] `terraform fmt` was applied\n- [x] All atlantis plans can be applied\n- [x] (For reviewers) I have verified the resource changes\n\n---",

Here are the steps to resolve the identified cross-reference issues in your Terraform configuration:\n\n1. **Define Local Variables:**\n   - You need to define the local variables `local.aws_account_name`, `local.region`, and `local.name` in a `locals` block. This can be done in any `.tf` file within your configuration.\n\n   Example:\n   ```hcl\n   locals {\n     aws_account_name = \"your_account_name\"\n     region           = \"us-east-2\"\n     name             = \"your_cluster_name\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that the values assigned to these variables are correct and reflect your intended configuration.\n\n2. **Define the Missing Module:**\n   - The `module.eks_all_in_one` needs to be defined. This involves creating a module block that specifies the source of the module and provides any required input variables.\n\n   Example:\n   ```hcl\n   module \"eks_all_in_one\" {\n     source = \"./path_to_module\"\n     # Add necessary input variables here\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Make sure the path to the module is correct and that you provide all necessary inputs that the module requires.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will resolve the cross-reference issues and ensure that your Terraform configuration is complete and functional.

By incorporating these improvements, the generator will not only identify direct cross-reference issues but also anticipate potential configuration gaps that could lead to runtime errors or misconfigurations. This proactive approach will be invaluable for users, ensuring that their Terraform configurations are both complete and aligned with best practices. Here\u2019s a concise summary of the proposed enhancements:\n\n1. **Flag Empty Variable Files**: Alert users to verify missing variable definitions in newly created or modified files, preventing potential misconfigurations.\n\n2. **Check for Expected Variable Definitions**: Use project-specific templates or common practices to ensure all necessary variables are defined, catching deviations early.\n\n3. **Enhance Module Interface Checks**: Ensure all module inputs are provided and outputs are utilized, preventing incomplete configurations and unexpected behavior.\n\nThese adjustments will significantly enhance the generator's capability to validate Terraform configurations effectively, providing a more comprehensive and reliable validation process.",

However, it can be enhanced to better reflect the changes made in the pull request. Here is a suggested revision:\n\n---\n\nThis pull request addresses [SRE-6532](https://cisco-eti.atlassian.net/browse/SRE-6532) by implementing the following changes:\n\n- **Creation of EKS Cluster:** Utilizes Terraform to set up the `eks-imangass-test` cluster in the `eu-west-1` region. This includes configuring the backend with S3 for state management and setting up the necessary AWS and Vault providers for secure access.\n  \n- **Installation of Base Applications:** Deploys essential base applications within the newly created EKS cluster using the `eso_eticloud` module. This module is sourced from the Cisco ETI repository and is configured to manage external secrets.\n\n- **Security and Configuration Management:** Integrates Vault for managing AWS credentials securely and configures the necessary IAM roles and policies for the EKS cluster.\n\nThese changes are part of our ongoing efforts to streamline infrastructure management and enhance the security and scalability of our cloud resources.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [JIRA ticket SRE-6532](https://cisco-eti.atlassian.net/browse/SRE-6532?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ).",

To resolve the issue with `aws_vpc_peering_connection.data_to_app.id`, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Define the Missing Resource:**\n   If `data_to_app` is meant to be a separate `aws_vpc_peering_connection` resource, you should define it in the Terraform configuration. Ensure it has the necessary attributes and configuration to establish the VPC peering connection.\n\n   Example definition:\n   ```hcl\n   resource \"aws_vpc_peering_connection\" \"data_to_app\" {\n     peer_owner_id = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id\n     peer_vpc_id   = data.aws_vpc.requestor_vpc.id\n     vpc_id        = data.aws_vpc.acceptor_vpc.id\n     auto_accept   = true\n\n     accepter {\n       allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = true\n     }\n\n     requester {\n       allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = true\n     }\n\n     tags = {\n       Name                  = \"VPC Peering between rosey-dev-data-euw1-1 and rosey-dev-euw1-1\"\n       CSBApplicationName    = \"dev-data-dev-app-peering\"\n       CSBCiscoMailAlias     = \"eti-sre@cisco.com\"\n       CSBDataClassification = \"Cisco Confidential\"\n       CSBDataTaxonomy       = \"Cisco Operations Data\"\n       CSBEnvironment        = \"NonProd\"\n       CSBResourceOwner      = \"Outshift SRE\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Correct the Reference:**\n   If `data_to_app` was a typo or incorrect reference, update the code to use the correct resource name. In this case, it seems like the correct resource might be `aws_vpc_peering_connection.app_to_data`, which is already defined in the file.\n\n   Update the reference:\n   ```hcl\n   resource \"aws_route\" \"app_to_data\" {\n     count                     = length(data.aws_route_tables.requestor_vpc_rt.ids)\n     route_table_id            = data.aws_route_tables.requestor_vpc_rt.ids[count.index]\n     destination_cidr_block    = data.aws_vpc.acceptor_vpc.cidr_block\n     vpc_peering_connection_id = aws_vpc_peering_connection.app_to_data.id\n   }\n   ```\n\nChoose the option that best fits the intended architecture and configuration of your Terraform setup.

Here\u2019s how you can address the issue based on the options you mentioned:\n\n1. **Define the `data_to_app` Resource**:\n   If `data_to_app` is meant to be a separate VPC peering connection, you can define it like this in your Terraform configuration:\n\n   ```hcl\n   resource \"aws_vpc_peering_connection\" \"data_to_app\" {\n     peer_owner_id = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id\n     peer_vpc_id   = data.aws_vpc.requestor_vpc.id\n     vpc_id        = data.aws_vpc.acceptor_vpc.id\n     auto_accept   = true\n\n     accepter {\n       allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = true\n     }\n\n     requester {\n       allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = true\n     }\n\n     tags = {\n       Name               = \"VPC Peering between rosey-dev-data-euw1-1 and rosey-dev-euw1-1\"\n       ApplicationName    = \"data-to-app-peering\"\n       CiscoMailAlias     = \"eti-sre-admins@cisco.com\"\n       DataClassification = \"Cisco Confidential\"\n       DataTaxonomy       = \"Cisco Operations Data\"\n       Environment        = \"NonProd\"\n       ResourceOwner      = \"ETI SRE\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Correct the Reference**:\n   If `data_to_app` was mistakenly referenced and should point to an existing resource, update the reference in your routing resources to use the correct resource name. For example, if it should be `app_to_data`, update the route resource like this:\n\n   ```hcl\n   resource \"aws_route\" \"app_to_data\" {\n     count                     = length(data.aws_route_tables.requestor_vpc_rt.ids)\n     route_table_id            = data.aws_route_tables.requestor_vpc_rt.ids[count.index]\n     destination_cidr_block    = data.aws_vpc.acceptor_vpc.cidr_block\n     vpc_peering_connection_id = aws_vpc_peering_connection.app_to_data.id\n   }\n   ```\n\nChoose the option that best fits your intended architecture.

Ensure it includes the necessary attributes such as `peer_owner_id`, `peer_vpc_id`, `vpc_id`, and any other required configurations.\n\n   Example:\n   ```hcl\n   resource \"aws_vpc_peering_connection\" \"data_to_app\" {\n     peer_owner_id = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id\n     peer_vpc_id   = data.aws_vpc.requestor_vpc.id\n     vpc_id        = data.aws_vpc.acceptor_vpc.id\n     auto_accept   = true\n\n     accepter {\n       allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = true\n     }\n\n     requester {\n       allow_remote_vpc_dns_resolution = true\n     }\n\n     tags = {\n       Name = \"VPC Peering between rosey-dev-data-euw1-1 and rosey-dev-euw1-1\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Dependencies**:\n   - Ensure that the VPCs referenced by `peer_vpc_id` and `vpc_id` are correctly defined and accessible.\n   - Check that the `aws_caller_identity` data source is correctly configured to retrieve the current account ID.\n\n3. **Validate the Configuration**:\n   - Run `terraform validate` to ensure there are no syntax errors or misconfigurations in your Terraform files.\n\n4. **Plan and Apply Changes**:\n   - Execute `terraform plan` to review the changes that Terraform will apply. This step helps confirm that the new resource is correctly defined and will be created as expected.\n   - If the plan looks good, proceed with `terraform apply` to implement the changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the missing `aws_vpc_peering_connection.data_to_app` resource.

To resolve the confirmed issue of `aws_iam_role.vowel-demo` being used but not defined, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Define the IAM Role**: Add a new Terraform resource block to define the `aws_iam_role` that is referenced. This should be done in a new or existing `.tf` file, such as `aws_vowel-genai-dev_us-east-2_sagemaker_outshift-vowel-demo-sagemaker_iam.tf`.\n\n   Here's an example of how you might define the IAM role:\n\n   ```hcl\n   resource \"aws_iam_role\" \"vowel-demo\" {\n     name = \"vowel-demo-role\"\n\n     assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.sagemaker_assume_role.json\n   }\n\n   resource \"aws_iam_policy\" \"vowel-demo-policy\" {\n     name   = \"vowel-demo-policy\"\n     policy = jsonencode({\n       Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n       Statement = [\n         {\n           Action   = \"sagemaker:*\"\n           Effect   = \"Allow\"\n           Resource = \"*\"\n         },\n         {\n           Action   = \"logs:*\"\n           Effect   = \"Allow\"\n           Resource = \"*\"\n         }\n       ]\n     })\n   }\n\n   resource \"aws_iam_role_policy_attachment\" \"vowel-demo-attach\" {\n     role       = aws_iam_role.vowel-demo.name\n     policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.vowel-demo-policy.arn\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Adjust Permissions**: Ensure that the IAM role has the necessary permissions for the actions it needs to perform. This might involve attaching additional policies or modifying the existing policy.\n\n3. **Validate and Apply**: After defining the IAM role, run `terraform validate` to ensure there are no syntax errors, and then `terraform plan` to see the changes that will be applied. If everything looks good, apply the changes with `terraform apply`.\n\nIf you have any specific requirements for the IAM role or need further customization, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance!",

                "reasoning": "The review comment accurately points out a specific configuration setting that could affect the usability of instance tags. It is relevant since instance metadata tags can be important for workloads that rely on tagging for management and automation. However, a perfect score is not warranted as the comment could be more constructive by suggesting when it might be appropriate to enable the setting based on use cases."

It is relevant because incorrect encoding could lead to connection issues with the Kubernetes cluster. However, it could be enhanced by suggesting specific checks or best practices to ensure the encoding is correct and secure, which is why it doesn't receive a perfect score."

This is relevant as unnecessary dependencies can lead to complications in resource management and orchestration. However, the review could be improved by suggesting what to consider when determining if the dependency is necessary, such as whether 'module.eks' is responsible for creating or affecting the 'kubernetes_config_map_v1_data'."

                "reasoning": "The review comment accurately identifies that the 'desired_size' variable is defined but not utilized in the module, which is a good practice in code reviews to ensure that the code remains clean and maintainable. However, it could be slightly improved by suggesting further investigation to determine if the variable is intended to be used elsewhere in the module or future plans for its use, rather than outright stating to remove it. Therefore, while the comment is relevant and useful, it lacks a bit of depth in exploring its potential usage."
