A more descriptive title would be:\n\n\"Enhance Encryption Documentation with External Command and Method Examples\"\n\n## PR Description Suggestion\n\nThe current description provides a checklist but lacks specific details about the changes made. Here's a more detailed description:\n\n---\n\nResolves #2337\n\n## Overview\n\nThis pull request updates the Terraform documentation to include examples of using external encryption methods. It introduces new examples and modifies existing ones to demonstrate the use of external commands for encryption and decryption.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n- Added new Terraform configuration examples in `website_docs_language_state_examples_encryption_externalcommand.tf` to illustrate the use of external commands for encryption.\n- Updated `website_docs_language_state_examples_encryption_keyprovider-external.tf` to correct the key provider from \"externalcommand\" to \"external\".\n- Introduced a new example in `website_docs_language_state_examples_encryption_external-method_method-external.tf` showcasing the use of separate encrypt and decrypt commands with optional key specifications.\n\n## Target Release\n\n1.10.0\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- [X] I have not used an AI coding assistant to create this PR.\n- [X] I have written all code in this PR myself OR I have marked all code I have not written myself (including modified code, e.g., copied from other places and then modified) with a comment indicating where it came from.\n- [X] I (and other contributors to this PR) have not looked at the Terraform source code while implementing this PR.\n\n### Go checklist\n\n- [x] I have run golangci-lint on my change and receive no errors relevant to my code.\n- [x] I have run existing tests to ensure my code doesn't break anything.\n- [x] I have added tests for all relevant use cases of my code, and those tests are passing.\n- [x] I have only exported functions, variables, and structs that should be used from other packages.\n- [x] I have added meaningful comments to all exported functions, variables, and structs.\n\n### Website/documentation checklist\n\n- [x] I have locally started the website as [described here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/website/README.md) and checked my changes.\n\n---",

Here is a suggested revision:\n\nThis PR addresses documentation errors related to the external key provider in Terraform examples. Specifically, it corrects the key provider name from \"externalcommand\" to \"external\" in the `website_docs_language_state_examples_encryption_keyprovider-external.tf` file. Additionally, it adds examples demonstrating the correct usage of the external key provider with the command configuration. \n\n## Target Release\n\n1.9.0\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- [X] I have not used an AI coding assistant to create this PR.\n- [X] I have written all code in this PR myself OR I have marked all code I have not written myself (including modified code, e.g. copied from other places and then modified) with a comment indicating where it came from.\n- [X] I (and other contributors to this PR) have not looked at the Terraform source code while implementing this PR.\n\n### Go checklist\n\n- [ ] I have run golangci-lint on my change and receive no errors relevant to my code.\n- [ ] I have run existing tests to ensure my code doesn't break anything.\n- [ ] I have added tests for all relevant use cases of my code, and those tests are passing.\n- [ ] I have only exported functions, variables and structs that should be used from other packages.\n- [ ] I have added meaningful comments to all exported functions, variables, and structs.\n\n### Website/documentation checklist\n\n- [X] I have locally started the website as [described here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/website/README.md) and checked my changes.",

This will allow you to read a password from a password manager and supply it as a passphrase:\r\n\r\n```hcl\r\nterraform {\r\n  encryption {\r\n    key_provider \"external\" \"foo\" {\r\n      command = [\"./some_program\", \"some_parameter\"]\r\n    }\r\n    key_provider \"pbkdf2\" \"passphrase\" {\r\n      chain = key_provider.external.foo\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Target Release\r\n\r\n1.10.0\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check of ALL items in this list for all PRs: -->\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [X] I have not used an AI coding assistant to create this PR.\r\n- [X] I have written all code in this PR myself OR I have marked all code I have not written myself (including modified code, e.g. copied from other places and then modified) with a comment indicating where it came from.\r\n- [X] I (and other contributors to this PR) have not looked at the Terraform source code while implementing this PR.\r\n\r\n### Go checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- If your PR contains Go code, please make sure you check off all items on this list: --> \r\n\r\n- [x] I have run golangci-lint on my change and receive no errors relevant to my code.\r\n- [x] I have run existing tests to ensure my code doesn't break anything.\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all relevant use cases of my code, and those tests are passing.\r\n- [x] I have only exported functions, variables and structs that should be used from other packages.\r\n- [x] I have added meaningful comments to all exported functions, variables, and structs.\r\n\r\n### Website/documentation checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have changed the website, please follow this checklist: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have locally started the website as [described here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/website/README.md) and checked my changes.\r\n",

                    "comment": "**PR Title Suggestion:**\n\nThe current title \"Fixes #2022: Running external commands as a key provider\" does not accurately reflect the changes made in the pull request. A more descriptive title would be: \"Add External Command Key Provider for Encryption in Terraform\".\n\n**PR Description Suggestion:**\n\nThe current description provides a good overview of the changes introduced in the pull request. However, it can be enhanced for clarity and completeness:\n\n---\n\nThis pull request addresses issue #2022 by introducing a new key provider for encryption in Terraform, utilizing external commands. The key provider can be configured as follows:\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  encryption {\n    key_provider \"externalcommand\" \"foo\" {\n      command = [\"./some_program\", \"some_parameter\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe external program is responsible for providing OpenTofu with key material through a series of steps:\n\n1. **Writing a Header:** The program must output a specific header to standard output, followed by a newline:\n\n    ```json\n    {\"magic\":\"OpenTofu-External-Key-Provider\",\"version\":1}\n    ```\n\n2. **Reading the Input:** The program reads input data from stdin in the following JSON format:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"external_data\": {\n        \"key1\": \"value1\",\n        \"key2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Writing the Output:** The program outputs the key material in the specified format:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"key\": {\n        \"encryption_key\": \"newly generated base64-encoded encryption key\",\n        \"decryption_key\": \"base64-encoded decryption key, if input meta was present, omitted otherwise\"\n      },\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"external_data\": {\n          \"key1\": \"value1\",\n          \"key2\": \"value2\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\nAdditionally, this key provider can be chained with the PBKDF2 provider to utilize a password manager for supplying a passphrase:\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  encryption {\n    key_provider \"externalcommand\" \"foo\" {\n      command = [\"./some_program\", \"some_parameter\"]\n    }\n    key_provider \"pbkdf2\" \"passphrase\" {\n      chain = key_provider.externalcommand.foo\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Target Release:** 1.10.0\n\n**Checklist:**\n\n- I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- I have not used an AI coding assistant to create this PR.\n- I have written all code in this PR myself OR I have marked all code I have not written myself with a comment indicating where it came from.\n- I (and other contributors to this PR) have not looked at the Terraform source code while implementing this PR.\n\n**Go checklist:**\n\n- I have run golangci-lint on my change and received no errors relevant to my code.\n- I have run existing tests to ensure my code doesn't break anything.\n- I have added tests for all relevant use cases of my code, and those tests are passing.\n- I have only exported functions, variables, and structs that should be used from other packages.\n- I have added meaningful comments to all exported functions, variables, and structs.\n\n**Website/documentation checklist:**\n\n- I have locally started the website as [described here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/website/README.md) and checked my changes.",

            "body": "As decided by the [RFC: OpenTofu Specific Code Override #1699](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/1699), this PR allows OpenTofu to read `.tofu` files.\r\n\r\nThe `.tofu` files replace the `.tf` files with the same name. In this PR, we addressed the following scenarios:\r\n1. If a `.tofu` file exists, we’ll load it instead of the `.tf` file.\r\n2. For [JSON Configuration](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/syntax/json/), if a `.tofu.json` file exists, we’ll load it instead of the `tf.json` file. \r\n3. For [test files](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/commands/test/), if `.tofutest.hcl`/`.tofutest.json` files exist, we’ll load them instead of the `.tftest.hcl`/`.tftest.json` files. \r\n4. For [override files](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/files/override/), if `_override.tofu`/`_override.tofu.json` files exist, we’ll load them instead of the `_override.tf`/`_override.tf.json` files. To further clarify, if a `main.tofu` file exists with the override file `main_override.tf`, we’ll load them both (unless `main_override.tofu` exists, and then we'll load it instead of `main_override.tf`).\r\n\r\nWe'll address `.tfvars` and `.tfvars.json` in a different PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If your PR resolves an issue, please add it here. -->\r\nPart of RFC: OpenTofu Specific Code Override #1699\r\n\r\n## Target Release\r\n\r\n1.8.0\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check of ALL items in this list for all PRs: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I have not used an AI coding assistant to create this PR.\r\n- [x] I have written all code in this PR myself OR I have marked all code I have not written myself (including modified code, e.g. copied from other places and then modified) with a comment indicating where it came from.\r\n\r\n### Go checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- If your PR contains Go code, please make sure you check off all items on this list: --> \r\n\r\n- [x] I have run golangci-lint on my change and receive no errors relevant to my code.\r\n- [x] I have run existing tests to ensure my code doesn't break anything.\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all relevant use cases of my code, and those tests are passing.\r\n- [x] I have only exported functions, variables and structs that should be used from other packages.\r\n- [x] I have added meaningful comments to all exported functions, variables, and structs.\r\n",
