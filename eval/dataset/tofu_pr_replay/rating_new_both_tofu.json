A more descriptive title would be: \"Add External Command Key Provider for Encryption in Terraform\".\n\n**PR Description Suggestion:**\n\nThe current description provides a good overview of the changes introduced in the pull request. However, it can be enhanced for clarity and completeness:\n\n---\n\nThis pull request addresses issue #2022 by introducing a new key provider for encryption in Terraform, utilizing external commands. The key provider can be configured as follows:\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  encryption {\n    key_provider \"externalcommand\" \"foo\" {\n      command = [\"./some_program\", \"some_parameter\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe external program is responsible for providing OpenTofu with key material through a series of steps:\n\n1. **Writing a Header:** The program must output a specific header to standard output, followed by a newline:\n\n    ```json\n    {\"magic\":\"OpenTofu-External-Key-Provider\",\"version\":1}\n    ```\n\n2. **Reading the Input:** The program reads input data from stdin in the following JSON format:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"external_data\": {\n        \"key1\": \"value1\",\n        \"key2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Writing the Output:** The program outputs the key material in the specified format:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"key\": {\n        \"encryption_key\": \"newly generated base64-encoded encryption key\",\n        \"decryption_key\": \"base64-encoded decryption key, if input meta was present, omitted otherwise\"\n      },\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"external_data\": {\n          \"key1\": \"value1\",\n          \"key2\": \"value2\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\nAdditionally, this key provider can be chained with the PBKDF2 provider to utilize a password manager for supplying a passphrase:\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  encryption {\n    key_provider \"externalcommand\" \"foo\" {\n      command = [\"./some_program\", \"some_parameter\"]\n    }\n    key_provider \"pbkdf2\" \"passphrase\" {\n      chain = key_provider.externalcommand.foo\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Target Release:** 1.10.0\n\n**Checklist:**\n\n- I have read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- I have not used an AI coding assistant to create this PR.\n- I have written all code in this PR myself OR I have marked all code I have not written myself with a comment indicating where it came from.\n- I (and other contributors to this PR) have not looked at the Terraform source code while implementing this PR.\n\n**Go checklist:**\n\n- I have run golangci-lint on my change and received no errors relevant to my code.\n- I have run existing tests to ensure my code doesn't break anything.\n- I have added tests for all relevant use cases of my code, and those tests are passing.\n- I have only exported functions, variables, and structs that should be used from other packages.\n- I have added meaningful comments to all exported functions, variables, and structs.\n\n**Website/documentation checklist:**\n\n- I have locally started the website as [described here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/website/README.md) and checked my changes.",
