The change in 'ResourceOwner' from 'ETI SRE' to 'websites' should be verified for consistency across all related resources and documentation.
The IAM policy document 'irsa' has a commented line for role assumption. Ensure that this comment is clear to future maintainers, as it may lead to confusion during role creation.
Variables 'aws_default_region' and 'eks_name' are added without default values. Consider adding default values or validation to ensure they are set correctly.

The 'compress' attribute is defined multiple times in the 'default_cache_behavior' block. This redundancy can lead to confusion and should be cleaned up to ensure clarity and maintainability.

The `aws_sqs_pre_process_collect_event_policy` resource has been added. Ensure that the SQS queue `marvin-pre-process-collect-events-staging-use2-1` exists and the policy is correctly scoped to the intended resources.
Thank you! To resolve the cross-reference issues identified, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define Missing Resources:**
   - **`aws_security_group.dragonfly_kg_1`**: Ensure that this security group is defined in one of your Terraform files. You can create a new file or add it to an existing one where security groups are typically managed.
   - **`aws_secretsmanager_secret.msk_connect_kg_password`**: Define this secret in your Terraform configuration. Make sure it is correctly set up with the necessary attributes and values.
   - **`aws_iam_role.msk_connect_execution_role`**: Define this IAM role in your Terraform files. Ensure it has the correct policies and trust relationships.

2. **Check for Typos or Misconfigurations:**
   - Verify that the names and references are correct and consistent across your Terraform files. Sometimes, issues arise from simple typographical errors.

3. **Organize Your Terraform Files:**
   - Ensure that your Terraform files are organized logically, with resources grouped by functionality or service. This can help prevent cross-reference issues and make your configuration easier to manage.

4. **Use Terraform Modules:**
   - Consider using modules to encapsulate related resources and variables. This can help manage dependencies and improve the reusability of your Terraform code.

5. **Run Terraform Plan:**
   - After making changes, run `terraform plan` to check for any remaining issues or errors. This command will help you verify that your configuration is correct before applying it.

If you need specific examples or further guidance on any of these steps, feel free to ask!

The addition of new policy references 'external-secrets-comn-staging-use2-1' and 'external-secrets-comn-staging-usw2-1' should be verified for correctness. Ensure these policies exist and are correctly configured in the vault.
**PR Title Suggestion:**

The current title "fix: creating backstage01" does not fully capture the scope of the changes made in this pull request. A more descriptive title would be:

"feat: Add IAM policies and AWS provider configurations for multiple environments"

**PR Description Suggestion:**

This pull request introduces several key changes and additions to the infrastructure configuration:

1. **AWS Provider and Vault Configuration:**
   - Added new Terraform files to configure AWS providers and Vault for various environments, including `aws_apisec-dev`, `aws_apisec-prod`, `aws_cnapp-datasecurity-prod`, `aws_cnapp-ui-production`, `aws_cybear-prod`, `aws_lightspin-prod-eu`, `aws_securecn-prod`, and `aws_sscs-prod`.
   - Configured Vault provider with alias "eticloud" and set up access to AWS infrastructure credentials.

2. **IAM Policies:**
   - Defined IAM policies for assuming roles with SAML and AWS for multiple accounts, ensuring secure access and management.

3. **Terraform Module Integration:**
   - Integrated the `sre-tf-module-eso-access` module for managing external secrets in the `aws_outshift-common-dev` environment.

4. **File Adjustments:**
   - Adjusted region settings in `aws_eticloud-scratch-c_us-east-2_eks_backstage-poc_main.tf` for consistency.
   - Removed and re-added provider configurations in `aws_eticloud-scratch-c_us-east-2_eks_backstage01_provider.tf` to streamline the setup process.

These changes aim to enhance the security and efficiency of managing AWS resources across different environments, leveraging Terraform for infrastructure as code practices.
The Terraform version and provider requirements are added multiple times across different files. Ensure this duplication is necessary or consider consolidating.

Ensure the local variables are correctly defined and consistent with other configurations. Verify 'vpc_name' and 'rds_name' for accuracy.
